    <h2>Previous School Projects</h2>
  <p>A big project I worked on in my college career that had an affect on others was a junior-year engineering project. My group was tasked with creating a device to assist people with limited mobility get into and out of a vehicle. Our project was so successful, that we were one of 3 groups that moved on to a second semester of redesigning our product. Things I provided were design ideas, a door frame to assist in demonstration as well as assembly of mechanisms within the assistive handle.</p>
